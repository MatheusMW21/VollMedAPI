## üíª **About the Project**
We are working on a project for a fictional medical clinic named Voll Med. The clinic requires an application to manage the registration of doctors, patients, and appointment scheduling.

The application will provide various options, allowing users to perform CRUD operations for both doctors and patients, as well as schedule and cancel appointments.

While a mobile development team will handle the application's front end, our team is responsible for developing the Rest API for this project.
